# optimalDefensiveTerra
Text application to determine the optimal defensive terra type for a pokemon.

run `javac OpDefT.java` in the main directory followed by: `java OpDefT type1 type2`

The application will then spit out two lists, the first is a list of what the pokemon was originally weak to, 
the second is a sorted list of all the possible terra types in order of how many weakness are eliminated. 
Resisting a x4 weakness is counted twice.
